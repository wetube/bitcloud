* Warning, please read first

The reason why we have published this before it is finished is because we want
to be really open in all regards.

We want to attract *thinkers* to discuss all the flaws we may encounter
in the hard road to make this incredible and big project to success.

Please contact us at http://talk.bitcloudproject.org
* TO-IMPROVE Introduction

Bitcloud is a new protocol based on the ideas of Bitcoin, Mediaglobin, and
Tor.

Users adhering to this protocol will be able to:

  - Upload any file to the Bitcloud net and make it available to anyone.
  - Download and stream the content to anyone.
  - Select which moderator you want to use, from anyone.
  - Earn money from advertising or disable advertising completely.

Nodes adhering to this protocol will be able to:

- Generate and earn profitable income in relation to the bandwidth
    they share.
- Select what content they cache and serve by selecting moderators.

Moderators adhering to this protocol will be able to:

- Approve and categorize user content.
- Approve or ban nodes.
- Earn profitable income throughout advertising.

Any person can become a *user*, a *node* and/or a *moderator* at any time. In
addition to this, there will be client applications which serve as an
interface to the general protocol named Bitcloud. We are presenting Wetube as
the primary interface for our first version, but programmers can make any kind
of interface, providing that they follow the rules described in this protocol.

The Bitcloud blockchain can be independently accessed for money transactions,
so external wallets without using the main interface are perfectly feasible.

  Bitcloud works by following a special set of premises referred as
  /laws/. The laws in the software ensure that the system is running
  smooth without spammers and selfish serving, so everybody can trust
  the system. These laws are initially imposed by the programmers and
  can dynamically change over versions.

  The entire system can be fully scriptable in real time using simple to use
  and parse lambda expressions, so advanced users and programmers can tweak
  and modify the way in which they are connected to the Bitcloud net, embed
  actions into web pages, use in their internal programs (in any language),
  etc. Nodes can be accessed in real time by their owners with full control to
  the entire running system. We are looking forward an incredible level of
  flexibility in where all users can review and enhance the living (running)
  network.
  
** We plan to go mainstream

Our original idea is to make Bitcloud available for general use without
requiring special tools or software. The first interface for Bitcloud will be
Wetube, which is a collection of scripts running in the browser.

In addition, bandwidth is free for users.

This will allow a whole new possibilities for mainstream adoption not possible
with actual p2p protocols. Just to cite some:

- Embeddable in webpages by the insertion of a JS script acting as a very thin
  layer between users and nodes.
- Accessible from external languages, and  easy integration with any kind of
  program.
- Mobile applications that work out of the box without wasting bandwidth and
  resources.
- Rapid access without having to earn rights like in kademlia and
  bittorrent.

** Content and participant protection

Bitcloud separates the layer of selecting material from the storage itself,
and allows nodes to select which moderators to adhere.

Because nodes are totally free to choose moderators, determining who is
storing the content in the long term becomes a very fuzzy thing.

In addition, a node can also include protected content (the source and
destination cannot be determined) which they can serve at the same time than
unprotected content, so only direct access to the node can conclude into
liability. But because source and destination cannot be determined, finding
such a node becomes extremely difficult. This improves protection compared to
Tor.

* Keys for fast understanding

1. The Bitcloud Cryptographic Law (BCL) is a series of "laws", and there are
   "judges" in such a way that workers in the net judge other workers and
   emit "verdicts". Consensus in the verdicts enforce the appliance of the
   law in the form of rewards and penalizations, and store them in the
   Blockchain and Node Pool.
   
2. The Bandwidth Law is the law ensuring that nodes route traffic from users
   to the Bitcloud net to get/post content. Nodes are paid for doing so, by
   generating money. /See Unprotected Routing section/
   
3. The Dispersion Law ensures that no one tries to cheat the system. It does
   so by dispersing the connections from user to nodes and nodes to other
   nodes.
   
4. Storage Law ensures that nodes store guarantied content.

5. Service law ensures that nodes don't deny service.

6. We use our own language for control commands and objects.

7. Money transactions are stored in the blockchain.

8. Node states and verdicts are stored in the Node Pool.
   
* EARLY-DRAFT Workers
** TO-IMPROVE General

A worker is basically any entity that is a *user*, a *moderator* or a
*node*. We encapsulate this into a general class because all workers
have some variables in common, like the alias or the
public-key. Then we derive the specifics workers from this class.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/worker-class.png"
User:
class Worker {
 alias
 private-key
 public-key
 banned?
 banned-time
 protected?
 IP
}
Worker --|>  Node
Worker --|> Moderator
Worker --|> User
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/worker-class.png]]

**** TO-THINK alias

Is usually the name or nick chosen by the worker. _TODO We have
to think if we want to implement our own ID system or use an
existing one like Keyhotee or Namecoin.

**** private-key

The private key of the worker used to sign actions. By design the
worker never divulges its private key.

**** public-key

Is generated from the private key and is used for all wallet
operations plus to verify signatures in the judges and
enforcement (see below).

**** banned?

Is *t* when the enforcement routine determines so. A banned worker
cannot use the Bitcloud for a specific period of time defined in
*banned-time*.

**** protected?

Is *t* if the worker enters into a special mode in which all the
content it uploads, moderates or stores is encrypted and enrouted
protected (the IP cannot be determined). More below.

**** IP

The actual IP of the node or nothing if protected.

** EARLY-DRAFT Nodes

Nodes are the primordial base for the Bitcloud network and most of the work
is done there.

Nodes run the program *bitcloud*. This program maintains a cache of
files served and provides the necessary bandwidth for the *Client
Applications* to work.

Nodes also do the important work of providing [[https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/wiki/Proof-of-Bandwidth][Proof of Bandwidth]] so
the cloud runs consistently and everyone generates the money they
only deserve.

Like it happens with Bitcoin, a block reflecting all the
transactions are generated once every 10 minutes. This block
represents the consensus of the Bitcloud net about the operations
made in itself since the last block. It contains all the money
transactions made, including the ones generated by the nodes by
bandwidth sharing. In order to preserve space, it does not contain
all the details of the nodes states nor any content at all.

The blockchain is the chained collection of all blocks generated
by the Bitcloud network. Its contents are perpetual and
immutable.

In addition, there will be a *Node Pool*. This pool is regenerated
every 10 minutes after a new block is generated and contains the
state of all nodes. When regenerated, all nodes apply the rules
under the section *Proof of Stake* to it, to ensure that every
node meets the rules and no one tries to take advantages over the
rest.

The nodes store the content in the form of a cache pointing to moderators, as
defined in the variables.

- Moderators have a list of contents and/or users to which they are attached.
- Nodes select a list of moderators they want to be adhered to.
- Nodes store the content for the moderators

Moderators can't ever select Nodes. See *Moderator Class* for more details.

*Note:* anyway we can implement a kind of query that a moderator can send to
a node asking for storage in exchange of money, and the node is free to accept
or deny.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/node-class.png"
class Node {
 dns-name    
 max-download-speed
 max-upload-speed
 max-space
 signature
 accepted-coins
 moderators
 preferential-moderators
 cloud-moderators
 content-waiting-for-approval
 protected?
 shutdown-date
}
Worker -right-|> Node
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/node-class.png]]

**** max-download-speed and **max-upload-speed**

Are the variables that define how much the owner of the node
wants to share, expressed in Mb/s.

**** max-space

Is in Mb and it is the maximum size to allocate for the files
cache. When the space occupied by the cache pass this variable,
the least requested files are deleted.

**** signature

Refers to the public key of the node, used to sign transactions
in the BCL routines.

**** accepted-coins

Is a list of accepted coins for exchange. For example `'(BTC
LTC)`. If a node accept BTC, it must run the *bitcoind* daemon.

**** moderators

Is a list of normal moderators for which the content is accepted
to be cached. The content cache can vary, so a node can
automatically select the content to be cached in function of the
number of requests. If this variable is NIL, the node becomes
unmoderated and caches everything that goes through.

**** preferential-moderators

Is a list of moderators whose content is always going to be
cached entirely. This is useful for moderators that also own
nodes.

**** cloud-moderators

A list of moderators for cloud personal storage. These moderators
put a price for content storage. This content is guaranteed to be
stored until 1 year has passed since the user paid, or until the
user deletes it or the moderator stops supporting the user.

*Note*: the sum of the space required by the moderators in
**cloud-moderators** and **preferential-moderators** should be
less than **max-space**. *bitcloud* daemon should log a warning if
that happens, and POS policies could ban the node.

**** content-waiting-for-approval

A list of contents uploaded from the users that are waiting for
the approval of the moderators adhered to this node.

**** approval-timeout

How much time this node is going to wait for the approval on any
moderator adhered to this node. Passed that time the awaiting
content is deleted from the cache. Minimum time allowed is 12
hours. Defaults to 48.

**** protected?

Whether the node IP is protected and the content in the local
cache is encrypted with the private key of the node. But this has
some downsides, the most important is that data is routed
throughout many nodes, adding costs in bandwidth and latency.

**** shutdown-date

When is the node going to be shut down automatically. Useful for protected
nodes that serve delicate content.

** TO-THINK Moderators

Moderators are crucial to the well-working of the Bitcloud. Their
main tasks are:

+ Approve user content. The user select a list of moderators to which s/he
  wants to adhere, the moderator receives the request and decides if the
  user meets his/her requirements.
+ Categorize. A moderator properly corrects tagging of the content
  s/he receives from the user.
+ Advertising. Advertisers select which moderators they want to
  adhere, and ads are only shown in the content approved by that
  moderator. Moderators are paid for this, and they put the
  price. A part of this price goes to the publisher.


As a vital an important imposed limitation: moderators cannot choose which
nodes to adhere, but nodes can choose any moderators they want. This is a way
to avoid censorship because any node can store any content that the owner
wants. This is also a good way for nodes to make money without having to be
approved by anyone. An advantage for moderators: they don't have to have the
technical skills to maintain a node, and do everything from the user
interface, as the maintainer of the node can be another person, or even a
rented pre-configured node from an ISP.


#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/moderator-class.png"
class Moderator {
     contents
     trusted-users
     supermoderators
     advertisers
     ads-price
     ads-share-to-users
     tags
}
Worker -right-|> Moderator
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/moderator-class.png]]

*** contents

This is a list of contents that the moderator has been approved. Nodes who have
selected this moderator have the obligation to maintain a cache with the files
this moderator approves.

*** trusted-users

** TO-THINK Users

Users are the ones that obtain the benefits from the services of nodes and
moderators, because they are who send and receive the content.

The use of the system must be transparent to the user. S/he should be able to
connect using his/her client or browser without having to do anything special
and without requiring any technological expertise.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/user-class.png"
class User {
     votes
      wallet
      favorites
      moderators
      history
      updloads
}
Worker -right-|> User
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/user-class.png]]
** TO-THINK Alias and Keys

All the workers need an alias.

There are 2 kind of aliases:

1. Anonymous, it is the same as its public key, generated from a private key
   that only the worker knows. Length must be checked to ensure randomness.
2. Registered. The worker pays a quantity for a name, and that name is attached
   to his public key in the Blockchain forever.

** TO-THINK Key Management

Every worker owns a private key. A public key is generated from the private key.

The private key is never sent in any way. The worker is responsible for all
the security matters of managing this key.

The public key of nodes working for the current period is published in the
Node Pool.

Money transactions affecting the public keys of any worker are published in
the Blockchain.
** TO-THINK Routing
*** LATE-DRAFT HTTP as a base for user/node connections

Most communications between users and nodes are done using the well understood
and easy to use HTTP network protocol as a base. We choose to use HTTP because
it is enough for our requirements and because it is widely available.

We choose the default 80 port for communications, with the option for nodes to
select any other alternatives. The reason to use this port is that people
behind a firewall can still access the complete net without the typical
restrictions. Most ISPs prioritize this port over the rest, making it the
fastest and more reliable port. Also, censorship becomes much more difficult.

Nodes wanting to use the 80 port for other purposes (like for example a
classical web server) can use any of the Unix tools available to route
domains, like for example /nginx/.

We don't use any p2p low level protocol like Bittorrent because we need very
fast access with the less possible lag. It also happens that many ISP actually
censor Bittorrent protocol. In addition, using simple HTTP will simplify the
protocol very much.

*** TO-THINK GET/POST format
*** LATE-DRAFT Serving static pages (Entry points)

We are also supporting the serving of static web pages stored in the nodes
outside of the Bitcloud, in the official Bitcloud server program. These pages
are considered a wrapper for Bitcloud. The purpose of this is to allow nodes
to become entry points for users:

- To allow the users to download a full featured client.
- To allow the users to connect "hot" using a JavaScript client.
- To allow nodes to provide informational static content only relevant to that
  node. For example, a TV channel, a book editor, a corporate web. They can
  embed content from Bitcloud in those static pages.
- To publish the statistics of the node in real time to the WWW.

*NOTE*: those static pages are considered to be out of the Bitcloud, except
if the content is embed (and only for the content), so they don't apply to the
law of Bitcloud, nor to its benefits.

In addition to this, nodes can install their own HTTP server (like Apache)
and serve dynamic pages using local routing facilities like /nginx/.

*** DNS

We don't need to resolve node names because content is provided to the users
by simply requesting it to the nodes s/he connects to.

Each content is signed by a user and a moderator. The workers only have to
request the content matching the hash of the content, and the routing routines
are in charge of finding the nodes having it.

*** TO-THINK Registering a new node and connecting to the network

Every new node must register into the network and provide the necessary
details specified in the /Node class/.

*** TO-THINK Dynamically find routes

Every user is connected to a randomly selected collection of 4
nodes. /Dispersion Law/.

The user running a full featured user client can find those 4 nodes
directly. Typically the client will have a collection of trusted nodes already
coded in, and they can obtain the rest of the available nodes from any of
them.

The users running a thin client in JavaScript in the browser do obtain the
script from an Entry Point.

Both clients act as full workers and are governed by the laws. If a user do use a
corrupted client that tries to cheat the system, it is penalized and/or banned
by applying all the laws affecting users. /Service Law/.

*** EARLY-DRAFT Unprotected routing - Proof of Bandwidth

Every single user is connected to 4 nodes using the User Router coded in the
interface. These connections are meant to both transfer the content and to
apply the BCL (Bitcloud Cryptographic Law).

Example graph:
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/unprotected-route.png"
:User:     <-down-> (User Router) : Request Content
node Node1 {
(Node Router) as NR1
}
NR1 <-up-> (User Router)
node Node2 {
(Node Router) as NR2
}
NR2 <-up-> (User Router)
node Node3 {
(Node Router) as NR3
node Final3 as "Final Node C"
}
NR3 <-up-> (User Router)
node Node4 {
(Node Router) as NR4
}
NR4 <-up-> (User Router)
node Final1 as "Final Node A"
node Final2 as "Final Node B"
NR1 <--> Final1
NR2 <--> Final1
NR2 <--> Final2
NR2 <--> Final3
NR3 <--> Final3
NR4 <--> Final3
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/unprotected-route.png]]

The process (using the graph above as an example):

- The User Router finds 4 random nodes. This router is coded in the user
  interface. /Dispersion Law/
- The User Router asks the 4 nodes to find a route to the content. /Service Law/
- Nodes answer with route data. /Service Law/
- The User Router selects the fastest. The fastest is calculated in function
  of the data retrieved in the last point, and usually is a combination of
  bandwidth available and shortest distance. In the example, Node3 is the
  fastest because it happens to be also a Final Node for the requested
  content. The second fastest should be Node2 because it has more connections
  to nodes having the content. If the requested content is cached in any of
  the Nodes, it should be considered as fast as actually being a Final Node.
- Money is generated *only* in the User Router's connected nodes, never in
  the Final Nodes to avoid short circuits. Only exception is when the Final
  Node is also one of the connected nodes. /Bandwidth Law/
- If a Final Node denies service, /Service Law/ is applied.
- Optionally, connected nodes can cache the content so they don't need to
  retrieve the content from the Final Nodes if the content is requested
  often.
- While the User is downloading/uploading the content, it must inform all the
  connected nodes about the quality of the connection. If quality is low, he
  can select another route from another node and denounce about the issue to
  the other nodes, so they can apply the law. See "User Router"
  section for a better explanation. /Bandwidth Law/
- If quality is low, an Investigation Process to find the culprit is
  executed. Culprit can be the Final Node, the connected Node, both, or
  none. /Bandwidth Law/ - /Check low quality culprit/ section.
- User is banned if he tries to abuse bandwidth or the law. /Bandwidth Law/ -
  /Abuse check/ section.
- Law is enforced when at least 3 of the 5 workers agrees (the 5 workers are 1
  user + 4 nodes).

*** EARLY-DRAFT Protected routing - Proof of Bandwidth

When a content is marked as *protected*, the Bitcloud net protects both the IP
and domain name of the node serving the content. The user requesting the
connection is also protected. There is still a way for auditors to know that a
certain computer is acting as a protected node, but will not be able to know
what is the protected content that is serving. Even more, external auditors
cannot distinguish between the content routed or served while analyzing the
traffic to a specific node.

All nodes are enforced to accept protected content routed, even if they are
not protected themselves. Nodes cannot know what is the content being routed
because of multi-layer encryption.

We use a routing process similar to Tor Onion hidden services, optimized to
our purposes.

mnodeE <--> pnode
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/protected-route.png]]

- The user chooses a collection of 4 random nodes. /Dispersion Law/.
- The User Router (coded in the interface) asks the 4 nodes to find a route
  to the Protected Node, encrypting the request with the public key
  associated to the Protected Content, and adding its public key inside the
  encrypted request (so only the real Protected Node can know what is sent
  back).  /Service Law/
- Each node tries to find a competitive route to the Protected Node and answer
  fast to the User. The way to do this is by sending the encrypted request to
  all the nodes it is connected to and wait for an answer. /Service Law/
- The Private Node is found when it is able to decrypt the request. Otherwise
  it is re-dispatched to all connected nodes.
- To protect itself, the Protected Node adds a random time (lag) of response
  to the request, equivalent to several searches. We recommend a random number
  between 1s and 5s. Once answered, the node must stick to that approximate
  lag, but can change it when requesting a different content for another
  moderator or when certain time has passed.
- There is the lucky possibility that a connected Node is also the protected
  one having the content (like Node1 in the graph). In that case the protected
  node adds the convenient lag time to protect itself.
- Meanwhile all nodes are attending other requests for other contents, so
  nobody knows if the other requests are actually part of the original request
  or not.
- The Protected Node always send back the content encrypted with the public
  key inside the request, so only the user can know what is the content.
- The User Router chooses the fastest route.
- *Only* the User Router's connected nodes generate any money, to avoid short
  circuit cheats. /Bandwidth Law/
- The User download/stream/upload the content throughout the fastest
  route. /Bandwidth Law/
- Meanwhile, the User informs the rest of the nodes about the quality of the
  connection. /Bandwidth Law/.
- If the quality is low, the User Router tries to change to other route
  Node while informing the issue. /Bandwidth Law/
- The selected node also enforces the /Bandwidth Law/ and /Service Law/ for
  the Middle Node it is connected to.
- Each Middle Node also enforces the /Bandwidth Law/ for their connections.

*** EARLY-DRAFT The User Router

The mission of the User Router is to find the fastest route to a solicited
content, whether it is protected or not.

It must be coded in the user interface and must respect the BCL in order for
the user to not be banned.

Its principles are simple, and should be easy to code in any language, even
in JavaScript for the browser.

#+END_SRC

* TO-THINK Language 

Bitcloud is a very complex distributed database and certainly cannot be
satisfactory operated without a proper language.

We choose a similar query language to SQL, but using s-exprs or lambda
expressions so it is easier to parse, use and expand. We provide many
convenient forms and functions so user interface designers can extensively
take advantage from them.

** Commands

Any command is visually constructed by first specifying the name and then
their parameters, all between parenthesis, this way:

: (command value1 :param2 value2 :param3 value3)

All parameter names are prefixed with a /:/.

The first /value/ doesn't need a parameter name because it is the fundamental
parameter for the command.

The rest of the parameters are named, and in fact their positions doesn't
matter at all.

Values can be of type:

- /strings/, surrounded by /""/:
  
  : (search "wetube")
  
- /numbers/ inserted directly

  : (search "wetube" :show-results 50)
  
- /single strings/ or /symbols/, they are the same as strings but used for
  just one word:

  : (search 'wetube)

- /literal lists/ prefixed by a /'/ and followed by parenthesis and values
  separated by spaces:

  : (search 'wetube :moderators '(modA modB))
  
- /booleans/ which are just /t/ or /nil/:

  : (verdict t :reward 1.23)

- /output from other commands/ surrounded by parenthesis without the /'/:

  : (search 'wetube :moderators (search-moderators 'mod :protected t))
  
** Object Format

In addition to commands, we also use lambda expressions to form the format of
objects, mainly used for return values from commands, blockchain transactions
and Node Pool states.

: (object value1 value2 :slot1 slot-value1 :slot2 slot-value1)

In contrast to commands, an object may have any number of unnamed values. It
can be the case that some objects just don't have any predefined slots.

Named slots are always at the end of the lambda list to avoid confusion.

It is better seen as examples:

: (verdict t :reward 1.23)
: (results )

** Why lambda expressions?

Mostly because they are easy to parse, extensible, and easy to construct lists
in. We are using a lot of lists and we must provide a way to effectively manage
them.  Another advantage is that we can also use the same language for the the
object and command formats.

Other alternative would be: a combination of SQL constructs and JSON objects,
but that would be harder to think and parse, and would require bigger programs
for small clients like JavaScript embedded scripts.

** Library

We provide many utility functions and constructs so workers can do very
advanced queries to nodes.

** Compression

Compression is very easy to implement for lambda expressions and happens in
real time when storing the blockchain in a file. We just need to assign a
constant binary number for every tag and store that number instead of full
names. Numbers can be stored in a fixed size 64 bit floating point format.

In addition, there should be a second compression pass using the standard LZO
libraries, available for all the languages.

* EARLY-DRAFT The Bitcloud Cryptography Law (BCL)


  The Cryptography Law, also called *Proof of Stake* in more simple
  projects, is the law of Bitcloud - what governs it - providing the
  rules in the form of algorithms executed by the nodes and clients in
  real time.

  Each rule must be applied for every node or client in the
  net. Appliance to every rule is rewarded in the way described in the
  rule. Non-compliance results in penalization.

  This fine equilibrium ensures that every node does the work
  correctly and there are no abuses.

  Like in the real world, here there are laws, judges and rule
  enforcers. The main difference is that here all nodes and clients
  are the judges and the rule enforcers, so the law coming in the form
  of computer algorithms is applied by the consensus of the entire
  Bitcloud net.

  We have named every rule with an easy to remember name, so workers
  of the system can refer to them when talking to other workers and
  non technical people.

** TO-IMPROVE Law appliance

Basically, the law is applied by judging (checking) that every node
and client is doing the work as it should, so, when asked, it
should answer with the truth of what is asked. If it is found that
the node or client is lying, it is penalized or banned, and its
transactions rejected are not included in the blockchain.

Laws are written in the source code in the form of *generics* and the
corresponding *methods*. A *method* is a specific application of a
*generic*. For example, for the *generic* of the Law of Bandwidth there
are going to be several *methods* for judging nodes, users and
moderators.

This is a subprocess of the general *sync* process, as described in the
Nodepool section.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/appliance1.png"
(*) -right-> [sync process] select workers to judge
-right-> judge workers
-right-> enforce verdicts
-right-> [freeze pool process] (*)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/appliance1.png]]


The return of those functions is always a verdict, in the form of
lambda expression, so it is easy to parse from scripts[fn:1]:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   (verdict t :reward 0.2345)
   (verdict nil :penalization 1.3 :ban 6)
#+END_SRC

The first var is *t* or *nil* indicating if the verdict is favorable or
not. The rest indicates the properties of the verdict, to be
applied by the *enforce* *generic*.

The purpose of it is to certificate (sign) the verdict and write it in the
Node Pool State when appropriate. When there is general consensus (for
example, 80% or more of the workers agree with the verdict), the current Block
is frozen and added to the Blockchain, and the Node Pool State is regenerated
using relevant parts of the old data for the new start.

** EARLY-DRAFT The laws
*** Time Law
**** TO-IMPROVE GMT sync Law

     - All nodes must be in sync of time with the official world time
       at GMT with a maximum variation of 10 seconds. Clients are not
       forced.

       : (defgeneric judge-time (worker))

     - Check is made sending a request to the other node and comparing
       to the actual date in the moment of sending the request.

       : (defun request-time (node))

       Function returns `(get-universal-time)` of the other node.

     - No reward for appliance.

       : (verdict t)

     - Penalization of 1 MAC (X) for every 10 seconds out of sync on
       each block generation. Ban for Y periods if it is 30s or more
       or the node hasn't got enough money to pay penalization. All
       operations of the node for the current block are rejected (Z)
       only if time variation is bigger than 30s.

       : (verdict nil :penalization X :ban Y :reject Z)

       Y is 1 for one time ban. Y is 6 if the node persists. Y is 144
       if it persists even more. Y (1,6,144)

**** TO-IMPROVE Timestamps Law

     - All nodes must write the correct dates in all connections and
       associated transactions.

       : (defgeneric judge-timestamps (node connection))

     - Check is made looking at the states written by the node in the
       pool. All dates must be correctly dated within the period of
       the block being analyzed.

     - No rewards for appliance.

       : (verdict t)

     - Immediate penalization of 1 MAC and ban for Y (6, 144,
       288). Reject all transactions.

       : (verdict nil :penalization 1 :ban Y :reject 'all)

*** EARLY-DRAFT Lag Law

    - All workers must answer in less than X seconds to any query or
      **sync** function. Recommended constant for now: 600ms.

    - No rewards for appliance.

      : (verdict t)

    - Ban X(1,2,6,144) if slow or saturated connections.

      : (verdict nil :ban X)

*** TO-THINK Bandwidth Law (Proof of Bandwidth)


https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/proof-of-bandwidth.org
  
  

**** TO-THINK Quality bandwidth check
**** TO-THINK Abuse Bandwidth check
*** TO-THINK Service Law
DRAFT:
Workers must answer to queries exactly as they are supposed to answer. The
worker informs to all other connected workers about how things are going on in
its relation to the connected worker.
Verdicts are written in the Node Pool as always.
If it is found that a node denies service to another worker, penalization
happens.
No reward for appliance.

**** DNS check
**** Query answer check
**** Availability check
*** TO-THINK Dispersion Law

Ensure randomness when selecting nodes.
We must provide a way to assign random nodes to concrete user IPs, and they
can't change for the time that a block is generated, to avoid users requesting
many random nodes in a short period of time.

This law also must forbid the connection of users to nodes using correlative
IPs to avoid the "bulk IP attack". Example: /123.123.123.X/ being /X/ the
correlative IPs.

At the same time we can optimize by connecting to geographically closer nodes
by prioritizing the assignment of certain nodes, for example those matching
the mask /255.0.0.0/. Only applicable if there are sufficient nodes inside the
mask to assure certain randomness.


**** Random connection check
**** Short Circuit check

*** TO-THINK Storage Law
Being discussed here:
http://talk.bitcloudproject.org/index.php?topic=10.0

*** TO-THINK Advertising Law
*** TO-THINK Enforcement Law
*** TO-THINK Money Law
* TO-THINK Blockchain

We use a Blockchain in order to store all money transactions, including the
ones coming from the nodes for Bandwidth sharing.

We are *not* using the Blockchain to store any information related to the
content at all. If we do so, very soon the Blockchain would become very
big. For such things, we use the Node Pool.

We can't use an existing Blockchain from another coin like Bitcoin for the
simple reason that we must generate the money from bandwidth sharing. But we
are providing exchange facilities that could be inserted in a user interface
like Wetube.

** TO-THINK Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file "img/blockchain-general.png"
Block1 : Born
Block1 -> Block2
Block2 -> Block3
Block3 -> BlockN
BlockN -> LastBlock
LastBlock -> [*] : Block being made
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/blockchain-general.png]]

** TO-THINK The cycle

A new block is generated once every 10 minutes after the Node Pool is synced
and signed.

** TO-THINK Format

** TO-THINK Simplification

In order to avoid some scalability issues, there is a process of
simplification that happens for data stored in the blockchain from certain
time backwards. This process removes all transaction data except the amount
of money owned by every account when due-date arrives.
* TO-THINK Nodepool

The *Nodepool* contains all the information relevant to the nodes, and it is
constantly calculated in real time.

** Regeneration

** TO-THINK Sync process
* TO-THINK Node Interface

  This is the interface for the node (not the users) so the
  administrator can see and tweak values in real time.

* TO-THINK Future as a Social Distributed application

  With not so much modifications, this DA could also provide social content
  with characteristics competing to those of centralized private sites like
  Facebook and Twitter.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] In order to make things easy for system administrators and programmers,
we are using lambda expressions. These are simple expressions enclosed into
parenthesis with the action in the first position. It is actually very easy to
translate from json-format to lambda expressions. We choose lambda
expressions because they need less space and are faster to parse and write.

[fn:2] Renting a server or VPS is very cheap today.
